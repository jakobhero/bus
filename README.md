This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies
Before getting started please be familiar with the stack below. Additionally it is important to understand basic [Git](https://gist.github.com/blackfalcon/8428401) and [Github](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) for smooth collaboration as a team.

- **Frontend**
    - React Hooks, Ant Design, Ant Design Mobile,  styled-components (Yet to be decided)
- **Backend**
    - Flask/Node.js (Yet to be decided)
    - Google Maps API
- **DevOps**
    - Docker, Terraform, Nginx, AWS (Yet to be decided)
    

#### Client

1. Fork or Clone this repository 'git clone https://github.com/jakobhero/bus.git'
1. install Node 12.16.2
1. Enter the `client` directory and run `npm install`.
1. Start the client app by running `npm start`, and wait for the app to start up. (`Starting the development server...` is not the final line).
1. Finally, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser - you should see a styled page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
